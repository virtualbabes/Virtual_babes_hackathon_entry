## Phase 1: Stability & Security Audit
1. **Complete:** Validated `verifyBuyInTransaction` logic against actual Indexer responses.
2. **Complete:** Implemented `sync.RWMutex` in `main.go` to harden the WASM Engine against race conditions during async card imports (Plan F).
3. **Complete:** Performed 16-player tournament stress tests to verify bracket archival and treasury kickback logic under load.
4. **Identity:** Ensure `LinkedWallet` verification handles all target chains (ETH/SOL/POL) consistently.

## Phase 2: Performance Optimization
- Refactored `handleVoiOnboarding` logic from `bridge_service.go` to `onboarding_service.go`.
1. Complete: Implemented partial state synchronization in `GetGameState` (Go & JS) to reduce serialization overhead.
2. Complete: Optimized Market Ticker canvas rendering with text measurement caching and viewport culling.
3. Complete: Hardened `syncUI` logic to support partial snapshots and prevent DOM flickering during high-frequency lobby updates.
4. Complete: Implemented granular node-diffing for `board-container` in `syncUI` to prevent flickering during card flips.
5. Complete: Displayed Cunning and Nurturing values in the `syncUI` profile overlay with Cyberpunk styling.
6. Complete: Implemented Club Lease Board overlay with regional prioritization logic.
