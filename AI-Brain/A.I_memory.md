# A.I. Memory: Virtualbabes Arena

## Project Context
- **Core Objective**: Evolving a tactical card battler into a Social Economic Simulation.
- **Tech Stack**: Go, WASM, WebSockets, Algorand/Voi Blockchain.
- **Current Phase**: Production-Ready Beta / Hardened Launch Readiness.

## Critical Logic Patterns
- **Switchboard Pattern**: Server-side signing for faucet rewards; client-side proof of intent.
- **Sybil Protection**: Onboarding is gated by historical paged indexer checks; addresses are normalized to lowercase.
- **WASM Determinism**: Core rules (Same/Plus/Combo) must remain identical between client and server.
- **Industrial Leases**: Club members can lease cards; revenue split: 50% Lender, 20% Faucet, 20% Treasury, 10% Members.
- **Domain Separation**: Logic is now split across specialized services (Battle, Economy, Club, Employment, Oracle) to reduce `Lobby` mutex contention.

## Active Priorities
1. **Mainnet Secrets**: Secure wiring of `FAUCET_MNEMONIC` and `ADMIN_WALLETS` for production launch.

## Completed Tasks
- **Documentation**: Merged `ReadMe.txt` into `README.md`.
- **Hardening**: Applied `sync.RWMutex` to `main.go` (Plan F) and refactored async fetch logic.
- **Validation**: Performed simulated 16-player tournament stress tests; verified bracket archival and kickback logic.
- **Rewards**: Hardened Top 5 placement identification and implemented atomic multi-asset distribution.
- **Maintenance**: Verified `cleanupNonces` correctly prunes history without affecting active spectators.
- **Audit**: Verified EVM `power_divisor` and `power_base` configurations.
- **Visuals**: Implemented canvas-based particle effects for card captures (Phase 2).
- **SCSS Refactor**: Integrated `.particle-canvas` styles into the modular utility system.
- **Moderation**: Hardened `handleAvatarBan` with URL normalization and enforced check in `register_avatar`; removed duplicate tournament simulation handlers.
- **Cosmetics**: Implemented 'equip_cosmetic' WebSocket protocol for switching active faceplates with inventory validation.
- **Admin Security**: Strictly enforced signature-based auth in `handlers_admin.go`; removed legacy keys; added EVM admin support.
- **Criminality**: Hardened heist logic to utilize `GetEffectiveCunning` (including faceplate bonuses) for success probability and kidnap eligibility.
- **Frontend Display**: Implemented display of Cunning and Nurturing values in `syncUI` with Cyberpunk styling.
- **Rewards**: Hardened `payoutAddress` validation in `faucet_service.go` to handle granular asset opt-ins.
- **Economy Audit**: Ensured loan interest and auction commissions are added to `l.faucetBalance` before dynamic scaling.
- **Stability**: Resolved critical deadlocks between `economy_processing.go` and `lobby_manager.go`.
- **Liquidity**: Implemented "Industrial Loop" recovery where black market scavenge fees return to the Faucet pool.
- **Attributes**: Wired Cunning (Stealth) and Nurturing (Fatigue Care) into the deterministic power calculation.
- **Hardening**: Aligned server-side power validation with WASM Cunning/Nurturing logic and secured `handleMove` against power spoofing.
- **Economy**: Implemented stack-wide Dynamic Scaling in `economy_service.go` with unscaled target tracking.
- **Rewards Audit**: Verified Reputation Bonus multiplier is consistently applied across all reward assets in `faucet_service.go`.
- **Unit Logic**: Verified that `Treasury` and `FaucetBalance` use base $VBV units, while rewards use micro-units (1M conversion).
- **Lease UI**: Implemented `openClubLeaseBoard` in `app.js` with region-aware sorting based on player employment.
- **Economic Precision**: Hardened `handleTakeLease` to recover rounding remainders into Club Treasuries.
- **Market Hardening**: Refactored Portfolios to use persistent wallet keys; linked trades to `faucetBalance` to prevent inflation and ensure cross-session holdings.
- **Continuity**: Hardened `InitialRewards` persistence via `season.json` to ensure economic state survives restarts.
- **Sybil UI Feedback**: Frontend `app.js` now correctly informs users if Sybil protection is still warming up.
- **Frontend Optimization**: `syncUI` in `app.js` now uses string comparison flicker guards and filter-aware partial updates.
- **Identity Cache**: Implemented backend-side `envoiCache` and resolved potential recursive RLock deadlocks.
- **Auction Model**: Uses Server-Authoritative Internal Escrow. $VBV payments are live value; items are internal state.
- **Auction Card Escrow**: Fixed `CardID` missing from escrow logic in `auction_service.go` and `economy_processing.go`.
- **Identity Cache**: Implemented backend-side `envoiCache` and dedicated resolution logic for economic results.
- **Auction Bid Logic**: Hardened `handlePlaceBid` to deduct new bids and immediately refund previous highest bidders.
- **Loan UI Consistency**: Implemented non-blocking Envoi name resolution for borrowers in `loan_service.go`.
- **Mojo Decay**: Hardened `processMojoDecay` with UI broadcast triggers and ensured courthouse revenue refreshes `LastActivity`.
- **Profile Synergy**: Achievement and Player state now correctly sync from `lobby_update` into WASM `Engine` via `SyncFullProfile`.
- **Industrial Hardening**: Implemented inventory capacity guards in `handleRestockInventory` to prevent state bloat.
- **Periodic Tickers**: Resolved deadlocks in `processAuctions`, `checkVaultBalanceOnChain`, and `handleUnregister` for improved stability.
- **Reward Consistency**: Verified `dispatchReward` correctly applies reputation bonus multiplier to all reward assets.
- **Black Market Hardening**: Resolved deadlock in `handleBuyBlackMarket`, ensured reputation recalculation on Wanted Level increase, and added UI sync triggers.
- **Tournament Mechanics**: Verified `handleTournamentRegister` correctly bypasses buy-in verification for elite players.
- **Protocol Hardening**: Refactored `handleGameProtocol` to delegate to service files, fixed deadlocks, and added unhandled message logging.
- **Rumor Management**: Verified `processRumors` correctly deletes expired entries while holding the mutex.
- **Tournament History**: Implemented conditional deep verification in `handleTournamentHistory` based on `deep_verify` parameter.
- **Kidnap Gambit**: Hardened `handleKidnapRequest` with robust card selection (favorite vs. rarest) and explicit removal from victim's inventory.
- **Tournament Kickback Accuracy**: Ensured `distributeTournamentKickback` uses the precise blockchain transaction time for club membership verification.
- **Insurance Recovery**: Fixed `processInsuranceRecovery` to correctly return recovered cards to the victim's inventory.
- **Faceplates**: Cosmestic items now provide functional Mojo/Cunning bonuses via `FaceplateRegistry`. Mojo bonuses boost Reputation.

## Technical Notes
- **Economy**: `economy_processing.go` handles temporal cleanup (loans/auctions) independently of main handlers.
- **Coupling**: `app.js` is the primary consumer of WASM state; state changes in `main.go` require `app.js:syncUI` updates.
- **Narrative**: NPC Taunts are client-side based on server-evaluated tendencies (`collective-intelligence.js`).
- **Visuals**: Modular SCSS system with 3D CSS perspective for the world map.

## Orphans & Fixed Knowledge
- `bridge_service.go`: Placeholder for future expansion; current onboarding is in `onboarding_service.go`.
-- `payoutAddress`: (Resolved) Unified verification implemented in `faucet_service.go` reward loop.
